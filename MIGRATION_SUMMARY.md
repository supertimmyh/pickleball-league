## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### Local Mode (No Cloud Setup Required)

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip3 install -r requirements-server.txt

# Run server (uses local filesystem)
python3 server.py

# Open http://localhost:8000
```

**Default behavior - exactly like before!**

### Cloud Mode (Requires GCP Setup)

```bash
# Step 1: Set up Google Cloud (see CLOUD_RUN_DEPLOYMENT.md)
# - Create project
# - Enable APIs
# - Create buckets
# - Set up service account

# Step 2: Set environment variables
export USE_GCS=true
export GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT=your-project-id
export GCS_MATCHES_BUCKET=pickleball-matches-data
export GCS_CONFIG_BUCKET=pickleball-config-data

# Step 3: Authenticate with GCP (for local testing)
gcloud auth application-default login

# Step 4: Run server
python3 server.py

# Open http://localhost:8000
```

### Deploy to Cloud Run

```bash
# Follow the comprehensive guide in CLOUD_RUN_DEPLOYMENT.md

# Quick version:
gcloud run deploy pickleball-app \
  --source=. \
  --region=us-central1 \
  --set-env-vars=USE_GCS=true,GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT=$PROJECT_ID,...
```

## 🔐 Security

### Service Account Permissions

The service account is created with **minimal required permissions**:
- `roles/storage.objectAdmin` - Only for Cloud Storage operations
- `roles/logging.logWriter` - For Cloud Logging

### Data Protection

✅ Data encrypted at rest (Google managed)
✅ Data encrypted in transit (HTTPS)
✅ Service account isolated to application
✅ No credentials stored in code or Docker image
✅ Authentication via GCP service account

### Network Security

✅ HTTPS enforced by Cloud Run
✅ Public endpoint (can be restricted if needed)
✅ Auto-scaling prevents DoS
✅ Request timeout handling

---

## 💰 Cost Estimate

### Cloud Run Costs

```
Execution:
  - $0.0000667 per CPU-second
  - $0.0000042 per memory-GB-second
  - Free tier: 2M invocations/month

Current Config:
  - 512MB memory
  - 1 CPU
  - 0 minimum instances (no idle cost)
  - 10 maximum instances

Estimated:
  - ~1000 requests/month = ~$0.05
  - Free tier covers most typical usage
```

### Cloud Storage Costs

```
Storage:
  - $0.023/GB/month

Operations:
  - $0.005 per 10,000 writes
  - $0.0004 per 10,000 reads

Estimated for 50 matches/month:
  - Storage: <$0.01
  - Operations: <$0.01
```

### Total Estimated Cost
**< $5/month for typical usage** (mostly within free tier)
